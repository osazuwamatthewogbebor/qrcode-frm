## My process
I used HTML and CSS without any framework.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
I got a better understanding of the box-shadow property.

```css
 .card {box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 10px 20px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
}
```

### Continued development
I still need to work more on responsive design using the mobile first approach.
